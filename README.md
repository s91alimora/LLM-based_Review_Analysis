# LLM-based_Review_Analysis

In this repository, I share a project I did on DataCamp website: (Analyzing Car Reviews with LLMs)[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/2046]

This project requires the use of LLMs to solve diverse language tasks for a car dealership company.

## Project Description:
Prepare to leverage your practical skills by using pre-trained LLMs! In this project, you are an AI developer hired by an auto dealership company.

Your task is to implement pre-trained large language model (LLM) use cases for tasks such as analyzing and classifying customer reviews on cars, responding to inquiries about available car models, and translating the company's English text data into other languages.
